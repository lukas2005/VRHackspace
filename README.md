# How to help
There are two ways of helping :)
## 1. Make a donation
This is a simplest way of helping currently you can send me some bitcoins to addres provided here (i linked to external website because here you can be sure its up to date): https://keybase.io/lukas2005 (Just look for a bitcoin icon on the list)
Later i will add other ways of donating
## 2. Directly contribute by coding designing and making pull requests
Yes just directly start creating stuff you can submit single scenes, scripts, prefabs, textures, models, meshes, make fixes in old ones, make existing scenes bigger and better just remember to keep old stuff working :)
